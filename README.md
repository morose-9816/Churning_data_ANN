A Deep Learning Model :

Multivariate statistical classification technique

using Aritifical Neural Networks(ANN) to identify the problem behind unsual churn rates in a bank.


Problem : A Dataset consisting of 10,000 customers to identify the problem behind unusual churn rates.
          It included customer's credit score, geography, salaries, tenure, no. of products they possess,etc


Part 1) Data Preprocessing(Encoding Categorical Data, Data Splitting, Feature Scaling)

Part 2) Making ANN(Using Keras library and Tensorflow module)

Part 3) Making Predictions and validating the model

Result : 

A list of customers ranked by their probabilites to leave the bank down to the customer that has lowest probability to leave the bank.
